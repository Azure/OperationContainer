# OperationContainer
    
The OperationContainer is the api that defines the functions required to run CRUD operations in any async or longrunning operations in your system. The api is already generated in go, and mocks are available for use in testing.

## Updates

If any changes are made to the proto file, you can run the `./init.sh` file which will re-generate all the required files with your update.
